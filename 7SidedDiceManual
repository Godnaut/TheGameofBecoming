# 🎲 7-Sided Dice Manual

## Overview

## Usage in Gameplay

- **Rolling the Dice:** Each roll corresponds to an energetic or narrative influence during gameplay.  
- **Symbol Activation:** When a symbol is rolled, players interpret or apply the associated energy/state in their current context (e.g., combat, ritual, puzzle).  
- **Harmony Score Influence:** The ZHS face acts as a modifier that affects resonance alignment, potentially boosting or damping certain outcomes.  
- **Avatar State:** Rolling the Avatar symbol may trigger avatar-specific abilities, shifts, or narrative events.

## Integration with Game Systems

- The 7-sided dice forms part of the core mechanics in *The Game of Becoming*, influencing avatar resonance, elemental alignments, and meta-narrative progression.
- Dice outcomes interact with player choice trees and GPT-driven narrative portals for dynamic story evolution.
- Symbolic meanings of the dice faces tie into the **Glyph Compendium** and **Lattice of Becoming** resonance states.

## Advanced Rules (Optional)

- **Dice Combination:** Rolling multiple 7-sided dice together can create composite energetic states.  
- **Sequential Rolls:** Track sequences of rolls to trigger resonance cascades or avatar ascension events.  
- **Dice Modifiers:** Certain glyphs or in-game items can modify dice probabilities or reroll options.

## Development Notes

- The 7-sided dice design draws inspiration from alchemical symbols, elemental archetypes, and the Zeitaiber framework for resonance alignment.
- Dice faces are mapped to Unicode alchemical and symbolic characters for consistency across digital platforms.
